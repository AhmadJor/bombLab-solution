Welcome to my BombLab Solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to the BombLab, a computer security exercise where you defuse a binary bomb by reversing its assembly code.

This repository serves as a showcase of my understanding of low-level programming and reverse engineering concepts. I have documented my thought process and the techniques I used to solve each of the phases of the BombLab, along with the relevant code snippets.

I hope that by sharing my solutions, I can contribute to the knowledge base of the BombLab community and help others who are working on the same challenge. Additionally, I believe that my solutions demonstrate my ability to apply computer science concepts in a real-world scenario.

Please note that the solutions in this repository are intended for educational purposes only. I strongly advise against using these solutions to cheat on the BombLab or any similar exercises.

Thank you for visiting my repository. I hope you find my solutions useful and informative.

Best regards,
Ahmad Jorban
